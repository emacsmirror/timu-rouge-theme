2 Configuration
***************

Scaling
-------

You can now scale some faces (in ‘org-mode’ for now):

   • ‘org-document-info’
   • ‘org-document-title’
   • ‘org-level-1’
   • ‘org-level-2’
   • ‘org-level-3’

More to follow in the future.

By default the scaling is turned off.  To setup the scaling add the following
to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

Default scaling

   This will turn on default values of scaling in the theme.

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-document-title t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-document-info t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-level-1 t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-level-2 t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-level-3 t)

Custom scaling

   You can choose your own scaling values as well.  The following is a somewhat
   exaggerated example.

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-document-title 1.8)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-document-info 1.4)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-level-1 1.8)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-level-2 1.4)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-scale-org-level-3 1.2)

"Intense" colors for org-mode
-----------------------------

To emphasize some elements in org-mode.  You can set a variable to make some
faces more "intense".

By default the intense colors are turned off.  To turn this on add the
following to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-org-intense-colors t)

Muted colors for the theme
--------------------------

You can set muted colors for the theme.

By default muted colors are turned off.  To turn this on add the following to
your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-muted-colors t)

Border for the mode-line
------------------------

You can set a variable to add a border to the mode-line.

By default the border is turned off.  To turn this on add the following to your
‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-rouge-mode-line-border t)
